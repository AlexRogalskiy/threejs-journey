This project is a community driven collection of lesson-examples from Bruno Simons [threejs-journey](https://threejs-journey.com) ported to [React](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), one of the best resources for learning threejs. The focus is entirely on the experience, these examples are as reduced as possible and will, if possible, use eco-system spare parts.
