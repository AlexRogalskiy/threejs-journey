This project is a community driven collection of lesson-examples from Bruno Simons [threejs-journey](https://threejs-journey.com) ported to [React](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). Threejs-journey is one of the best resources for learning threejs and we believe this project will ease the learning curve for both Threejs devs and React devs since we're moving from OOP to components, which greatly helps to introduce order and clean separation, but also has a larger impact in reducing code. The focus is entirely on the experience, these examples are as reduced as possible and will, if possible, use eco-system spare parts.
