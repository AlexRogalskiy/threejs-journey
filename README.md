This project is a community driven collection of lesson-examples from Bruno Simons [threejs-journey](https://threejs-journey.com) ported to [React](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber).

Threejs-journey is one of the best resources available for learning threejs, but writing Threejs with OOP constructs has downsides as it often yields complicated and interwired code that is hard to make sense of. We believe this project will ease the learning curve for both Threejs devs and React devs since we're moving from OOP to components, which introduce order and clean separation, but also have a larger impact in reducing code. 

The focus is entirely on the experience, these examples are reduced down to their essence and will use eco-system spare parts where possible.
