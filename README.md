This project is a community driven collection of lesson-examples from Bruno Simons [threejs-journey](https://threejs-journey.com) ported to [React](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). Threejs-journey is one of the best resources available for learning threejs and we encourage everyone to buy it! 

If you have used Threejs before you probably have noticed that expressing it imperatively or with OOP constructs often yields complicated and interwired code that is hard to make sense of. We believe this project will ease the learning curve for both Threejs devs and React devs since we're moving from OOP to components. This will introduce order and clean separation, but it also has a larger impact in reducing code. 

The focus is entirely on the experience, these examples are reduced down to their essence and will use eco-system spare parts where possible.
